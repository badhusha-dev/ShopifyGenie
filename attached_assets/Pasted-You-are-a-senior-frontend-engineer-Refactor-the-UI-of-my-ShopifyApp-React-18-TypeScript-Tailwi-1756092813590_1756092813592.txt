You are a senior frontend engineer. Refactor the UI of my ShopifyApp (React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + JWT + RBAC + Shopify API integration) to use a **modern, professional, Shopify-inspired design system**.

Goal
- Upgrade current Bootstrap-heavy layouts into clean Tailwind + shadcn/ui components.
- Ensure a **light theme with subtle shadows, rounded corners, white space, and coral/emerald accents**.
- Keep design responsive and mobile-friendly (PWA-ready).

Changes to Apply
1. **Global Layout**
   - Redesign sidebar and top navbar with shadcn/ui + icons (lucide-react).
   - Add collapsible sidebar with grouped sections: Dashboard, Inventory, Customers, Loyalty, Subscriptions, Vendors, Intelligence, Finance, Settings.
   - Use sticky header with quick actions (notifications, language switcher, profile dropdown).

2. **Dashboard**
   - KPI cards: large numbers, icons, gradient highlights.
   - Interactive charts with Recharts, clean tooltips.
   - Two-column responsive grid for widgets.

3. **Tables & Forms**
   - Replace Bootstrap tables with shadcn/ui DataTable (striped rows, hover states, sticky header).
   - Add filters/search as chips above the table.
   - Forms: use shadcn/ui Form + Input + Dialogs for Add/Edit (with validation feedback).

4. **System Settings & Integrations**
   - Tabbed layout with shadcn/ui Tabs.
   - Cards for integrations (Stripe, Twilio, SendGrid, QuickBooks) with logos + connect button.
   - Audit logs table with filters and icons for actions.

5. **Customer & Finance Pages**
   - Customer profile: avatar, loyalty points card, tier badge.
   - Finance dashboard: KPI cards (Revenue, COGS, Margins, Refunds %), bar/pie charts, payout table with status badges.
   - Wallet adjustment modal with clean form.

6. **UI Polish**
   - Rounded-xl cards, soft shadows, modern typography (Inter or Shopify-like font).
   - Toast notifications with shadcn/ui.
   - Dark mode support (optional toggle).

Requirements
- Do not remove functionality, only improve layout and style.
- Use Tailwind + shadcn/ui as primary UI, Bootstrap only if absolutely needed.
- Keep role-based access intact (RBAC).
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all pages.

Deliverables
- Updated global layout (sidebar + header).
- Restyled Dashboard, Inventory, Customers, Finance, Settings, Integrations pages.
- Reusable UI components (Card, KPI, DataTable, Modal, Tabs, Toast).
