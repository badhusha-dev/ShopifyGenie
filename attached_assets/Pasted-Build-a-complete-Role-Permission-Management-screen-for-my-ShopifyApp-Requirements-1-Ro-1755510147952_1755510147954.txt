Build a complete "Role & Permission Management" screen for my ShopifyApp.

ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:
1. Roles:
   - Super Admin
   - Admin
   - Staff
   - Customer

2. Permissions (CRUD style for each module):
   - Inventory: view, create, edit, delete
   - Orders: view, create, edit, delete
   - Users: view, create, edit, delete
   - Reports: view, generate
   - Settings: view, update

3. Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB/Postgres):
   - Add "permissions" collection/table with list of all available permissions
   - Add "role_permissions" mapping (role â†’ allowed permissions)
   - Create APIs (JWT secured):
     - GET /permissions â†’ list all permissions
     - GET /role-permissions/:role â†’ fetch permissions for a role
     - PUT /role-permissions/:role â†’ update permissions for a role (Super Admin only)
   - Middleware: validate both role and permission before allowing access to protected APIs
   - Ensure Super Admin always has unrestricted access (cannot be changed)

4. Frontend (React + Boostrap or Next.js):
   - Create a "Role & Permission Management" page
   - Display a table with:
     - Rows = modules (Inventory, Orders, Users, Reports, Settings)
     - Columns = actions (view, create, edit, delete, generate, update)
     - Checkbox matrix: checked = permission granted
   - Dropdown/select at the top: choose a role (Admin, Staff, Customer)
   - When a role is selected, fetch and display its current permissions
   - Allow Super Admin to toggle checkboxes and save â†’ updates role permissions via API
   - Save confirmation with toast/notification
   - Disable the screen for non-Super Admin users
   - Role badges for clarity:
     - Super Admin = Gold
     - Admin = Blue
     - Staff = Green
     - Customer = Gray

5. UX Rules:
   - Non-authorized roles shouldnâ€™t even see this screen
   - If a role doesnâ€™t have permission for a module/action, hide/disable that UI element everywhere else in the app
   - Show "Read Only" badge if Admin views this screen but cannot edit

6. Seed Data:
   - Default Super Admin: superadmin@shopifyapp.com / superadmin123
   - Default role permissions:
     - Admin: All except creating/deleting users
     - Staff: Inventory + Orders (no delete), view reports
     - Customer: Only view orders, view settings
