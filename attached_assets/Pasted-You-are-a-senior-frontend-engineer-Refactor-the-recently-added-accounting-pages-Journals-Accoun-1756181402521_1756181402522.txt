You are a senior frontend engineer. Refactor the recently added accounting pages 
(Journals, Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable, Wallets & Credits, Financial Reports, Bank Reconciliation, Taxes) 
to match the modern Shopify-inspired Bootstrap 5.3 design system we already implemented.

Goals
- Apply consistent modern styling, animations, and responsiveness to all accounting pages.
- Ensure all pages look as polished as Dashboard, Inventory, and Finance.

UI/UX Improvements
1. Layout & Styling
   - Use Bootstrap 5.3 components (cards, nav-tabs, offcanvas, accordions).
   - Apply Shopify-inspired gradient headers (#2ECC71, #27AE60, optional blue/purple from theme customizer).
   - Add consistent spacing, shadows, and rounded corners.

2. Animations
   - Smooth fade-in + slide-up for page load.
   - Hover lift + ripple effect for buttons.
   - Expand/collapse animations for rows and accordions.
   - Chart animations using Chart.js defaults.

3. Data Presentation
   - Replace raw HTML tables with `DataTable` reusable component (search, sort, pagination).
   - Empty state placeholders with icons + call-to-action.
   - Loading skeletons for tables and charts.
   - Status badges with color codes (Paid, Pending, Overdue, Partial).

4. Modals
   - Use `AnimatedModal` reusable component with gradient headers.
   - Apply tabbed forms inside modals (e.g., Journal Entry: General | Accounts | Attachments).
   - Animate modal open/close with backdrop blur.

5. Reports
   - Use `AnimatedCard` for KPI highlights (Revenue, Expenses, Net Income, Cash Flow).
   - Add interactive charts with Chart.js (line for P&L trends, pie/doughnut for expenses by category).
   - Drill-down links â†’ click on report line to open transactions modal.

6. Theming
   - Respect Dark Mode (Bootstrap 5.3 `data-bs-theme="dark"`).
   - Support Theme Customizer accent colors (green, blue, purple, coral).
   - All gradients, colors, animations pulled from centralized design tokens.

Deliverables
- Refactor all accounting pages with consistent modern design.
- Apply Bootstrap 5.3 responsive classes and utilities.
- Add smooth animations and micro-interactions.
- Replace dumb/static layouts with reusable components.
- Ensure mobile responsiveness and polished user experience.
