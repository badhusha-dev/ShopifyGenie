You are a senior frontend engineer. Refactor the **Customer Page** of my ShopifyApp 
(React 18 + TypeScript + Bootstrap 5.3 + JWT + RBAC + Chart.js + reusable Bootstrap components) 
to match the modern design system used in Dashboard, Inventory, and Finance.

Goal
Replace the "dumb" design with a professional, Shopify-inspired Bootstrap 5 layout 
using gradient KPI cards, animated tables, modals, and interactive charts.

Features to Add/Improve

1. Customer Overview
   - KPI Cards (Total Customers, Active Customers, Loyalty Points Issued, Avg Lifetime Value)
   - Animated counters with gradient backgrounds.
   - Hover lift effect like Dashboard cards.

2. Customer List
   - Use reusable `DataTable` component:
     * Search by name/email
     * Filters: loyalty tier, active/inactive, order volume
     * Sortable columns (Name, Email, Orders, Loyalty Points, Tier, Last Order Date)
     * Pagination + empty state placeholder
   - Hover highlight rows with smooth transitions.

3. Customer Profile Modal
   - Triggered by clicking a row in the table.
   - Slide-in `AnimatedModal` with tabs:
     * Profile (name, email, contact, preferences)
     * Orders (recent order list with status badges)
     * Loyalty (points balance, tier, redemption history)
     * Subscriptions (active/past subscriptions)
   - Gradient header + responsive design for mobile.

4. Analytics & Insights
   - Chart.js section below table:
     * Loyalty Distribution (pie chart: Bronze/Silver/Gold/Platinum)
     * Orders per Customer (bar chart with top 10 customers)
     * Customer Growth Trend (line chart, animated fill)

5. Micro-Interactions
   - Ripple effect on action buttons (View, Edit, Reward Points).
   - Smooth expand animation when filtering/searching.
   - Hover animations for loyalty badges (subtle pulse).

6. RBAC Rules
   - SuperAdmin/Admin → full access (CRUD + analytics).
   - Staff → view-only (cannot delete customers or adjust points).
   - Customer role → should never access this page.

Styling & Tokens
- Use existing design tokens for colors, gradients, and animations.
- Maintain Shopify-inspired emerald/coral theme.
- Apply consistent Bootstrap 5 spacing, shadows, and rounded corners.

Deliverables
- Updated Customer Page with modern Bootstrap 5 design.
- Reuse existing reusable components: `AnimatedCard`, `AnimatedModal`, `DataTable`, `BootstrapChart`.
- Consistent styling and interactions across Dashboard, Inventory, Finance, and Customers.
