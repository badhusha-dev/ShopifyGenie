You are a senior full-stack engineer. Extend my ShopifyApp 
(React 18 + TypeScript + Bootstrap 5.3 + Express.js + PostgreSQL + JWT + RBAC) 
to complete the **Advanced Accounts Module** beyond Chart of Accounts and General Ledger.

Goal
Implement the full accounting cycle with Journals, AR/AP, Wallets, Reports, Bank Reconciliation, and Tax Handling.

Features to Implement

1. Journal Entries
   - Manual Journal Entry modal with Date, Description, Debit/Credit Accounts, Amount.
   - Validation (Debit = Credit).
   - Recurring Journals option (e.g., monthly rent).
   - Save to `journal_entries` table, auto-post to GL.

2. Accounts Receivable (AR)
   - Customer invoices linked to Shopify orders.
   - Status: Pending, Partial, Paid.
   - Aging Report (0–30 / 31–60 / 61–90+ days).
   - Bootstrap DataTable with export options.

3. Accounts Payable (AP)
   - Vendor bills linked to Purchase Orders.
   - Track due date, status (Unpaid, Paid, Overdue).
   - Vendor statement page.
   - Payment posting auto-updates GL.

4. Wallets & Credits
   - Customer wallets: refunds/loyalty stored as credits.
   - Vendor wallets: payouts/advances.
   - Wallet adjustment modal (credit/debit).
   - Auto-entries to GL.

5. Financial Reports
   - Profit & Loss (Revenue – COGS – Expenses).
   - Balance Sheet (Assets, Liabilities, Equity).
   - Cash Flow Statement (Operating, Investing, Financing).
   - Drill-down: click line → see journal entries.
   - Export to PDF/Excel.

6. Bank Reconciliation
   - Upload CSV/OFX of bank statement.
   - Match entries against GL (Cash/Bank accounts).
   - Flag unmatched transactions for review.
   - Post reconciliation adjustments as journals.

7. Tax Handling
   - Tax accounts for VAT/GST/Sales Tax.
   - Auto-post tax portion on sales/refunds.
   - Tax summary report for filing.
   - Multi-currency support: FX gains/losses auto-posted.

Backend
- Extend PostgreSQL schema: `journal_entries`, `invoices`, `bills`, `wallets`, `taxes`, `bank_statements`.
- Express routes under `/api/accounts/*`.
- Middleware: JWT + RBAC enforcement.

Frontend
- Sidebar → Accounts → Journals | AR | AP | Wallets | Reports | Bank Reconciliation | Taxes.
- Bootstrap 5 UI with DataTables, Modals, Tabs, Charts.
- Reuse existing components: AnimatedCard, AnimatedModal, DataTable, Chart wrappers.
- Shopify-inspired styling with gradients + animations.

RBAC
- SuperAdmin/Admin → Full CRUD.
- Staff → View-only.
- Customers → No access.

Deliverables
- Extended backend APIs + DB schemas for accounting features.
- Frontend pages with modern Bootstrap 5 UI.
- Exportable README-ACCOUNTS.md documenting data model, workflows, and usage.
