You are a senior full-stack engineer. 
Enhance the Shopify-inspired Accounting App (React + Bootstrap 5.3 frontend, Express/Node.js backend, JWT + RBAC auth, DataTable/AnimatedModal/AnimatedCard/BootstrapChart components) with Advanced Vendor Management.

âœ¨ Goal
Implement complete Vendor Management integrated with Accounts Payable (AP) and Financial Reports.

ðŸ“¦ Features to Implement

1. Vendor Master Data
- Vendor table (DataTable with search/sort/pagination).
- Fields: Name, Category, Contact Info, Tax ID, Currency, Payment Terms, Rating.
- Detail view (AnimatedModal with gradient header + tabs: Info | Documents | Analytics).
- Status badges for Active/Inactive vendors.
- Empty state + skeleton loaders.

2. Vendor Accounts (AP Integration)
- Each vendor has a sub-ledger account linked to Accounts Payable.
- Show real-time outstanding balance (unpaid invoices, credits, prepayments).
- AnimatedCard for quick stats: Outstanding Balance, Credits, Prepayments.

3. Purchase Orders (PO) & Invoices
- PO lifecycle: Draft â†’ Approved â†’ Sent â†’ Matched.
- DataTable for vendor POs (sortable, filterable).
- Invoice management: Upload/Add invoice â†’ auto-link to PO if exists.
- 3-way matching: PO â†” Invoice â†” Goods Receipt.

4. Payment Workflows
- Payable schedule by vendor (Net 30, Net 60, etc.).
- Early payment discount calculation.
- Bulk payment selection + confirmation modal.
- Payment status badges: Unpaid (secondary), Paid (success), Overdue (danger).

5. Vendor Analytics
- KPI AnimatedCards: Total Spend, On-Time %, Avg. Payment Days, Dispute Ratio.
- Chart.js visualizations: 
  * Spend trend (line chart),
  * Spend by category (pie chart),
  * Aging breakdown (bar chart).
- Drill-down: Click chart â†’ open modal with related invoices.

6. Vendor Compliance
- Compliance documents tab (upload/download).
- Expiry reminders with status badges.
- Audit log: who added/edited vendor info.

ðŸŽ¨ UI/UX Guidelines
- Use Bootstrap 5.3 with Shopify-inspired gradients (#2ECC71 emerald, #27AE60 green, #FF6F61 coral, #3498DB blue, #9B59B6 purple).
- Support dark mode (`data-bs-theme`).
- Add animations: fade-in slide-up on page load, ripple effect on buttons, row expand for invoice details, smooth tab transitions.
- Responsive design (DataTables â†’ stacked cards on mobile).

ðŸ”§ Backend APIs (Express.js)
- `GET /api/vendors` â†’ list vendors.
- `POST /api/vendors` â†’ create vendor.
- `PUT /api/vendors/:id` â†’ update vendor.
- `DELETE /api/vendors/:id` â†’ archive vendor.
- `GET /api/vendors/:id` â†’ vendor detail (with invoices, POs, payments).
- `GET /api/vendors/:id/analytics` â†’ spend + performance metrics.
- `POST /api/vendors/:id/invoices` â†’ add invoice.
- `POST /api/vendors/:id/payments` â†’ record payment.
- Protect all APIs with JWT + RBAC (permissions: vendors:view, vendors:create, vendors:edit, vendors:delete).
