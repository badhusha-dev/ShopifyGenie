You are a senior frontend engineer. Refactor the remaining pages of my ShopifyApp 
(React 18 + TypeScript + Bootstrap 5 + Font Awesome icons + JWT + RBAC + Shopify API integration) 
to match the new **modern Shopify-inspired design** already applied to the Dashboard.

Goal
Bring consistent professional styling, animations, and Bootstrap 5 components to 
Inventory, Finance, Settings, and Integrations pages.

Pages to Refactor
1. Inventory
   - Add animated filter/search bar using Bootstrap input groups & dropdowns.
   - Modern DataTable: striped rows, hover highlight, sticky header, fade-in animation.
   - Add/Edit product modal with Bootstrap Tabs (General | Pricing | Stock), slide-in animation.
   - Low stock rows highlighted with Bootstrap badge.

2. Finance Dashboard
   - KPI Cards: Revenue, COGS, Gross Margin, Refund % with animated counters & gradient backgrounds.
   - Charts: Revenue vs COGS line chart + Category Margin pie chart using Chart.js with smooth animations.
   - Refunds table: flag option with Bootstrap badges + row animations.
   - Wallets: table with balances + modal for adjustments.
   - Payouts: table with status badges (Paid/Pending) + mark-paid button with animation.

3. System Settings
   - Bootstrap Nav Tabs with smooth fade transitions (General | Notifications | Security | Audit Logs).
   - General tab: form with modern Bootstrap floating labels.
   - Notifications tab: toggles for email/SMS with animated switches.
   - Security tab: inputs for rate limits, password policies.
   - Audit Logs tab: searchable DataTable with action icons & colored badges.

4. Integrations
   - Grid of Bootstrap cards for Stripe, SendGrid, Twilio, QuickBooks.
   - Each card: service logo, connection status badge, "Connect/Test" button with hover lift animation.
   - Use Bootstrap responsive grid to ensure mobile-friendly display.

Styling & Animation Requirements
- Shopify-inspired color scheme: green/emerald gradients (#2ECC71, #27AE60), coral accent (#FF6B6B), clean white surfaces.
- KPI Cards: animated counters, hover lift effect (scale + shadow).
- Tables: smooth fade-in on load, hover highlight transitions.
- Modals: slide-in and fade animations.
- Navbar + Sidebar: already styled, keep consistent.
- Toast notifications: Bootstrap 5 toast with fade-in/out.

Requirements
- Use only Bootstrap 5 (no Tailwind/shadcn).
- Maintain responsive design across desktop & mobile.
- Keep RBAC rules (SuperAdmin/Admin/Staff/Customer).
- Reuse common components (KPI Card, DataTable, Modal) across pages.
- Do not remove existing functionality, only restyle.

Deliverables
- Updated Inventory, Finance, Settings, and Integrations pages.
- Consistent Bootstrap 5 design with animations and Shopify-inspired colors.
- Reusable Bootstrap components for cards, tables, modals, and forms.
