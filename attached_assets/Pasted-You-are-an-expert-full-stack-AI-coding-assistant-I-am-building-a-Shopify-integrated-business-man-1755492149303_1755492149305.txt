You are an expert full-stack AI coding assistant.  
I am building a Shopify-integrated business management app.  
Some modules are not fully complete yet.  
I need you to **fully implement and complete the following pages without issues**:  

1. **Customer Portal**  
   - Show customer profile, order history, loyalty points balance.  
   - Ability to redeem points for discounts.  
   - Manage subscriptions (pause, skip, cancel).  
   - Clean, user-friendly UI with Tailwind cards and tabs.  

2. **AI Insights**  
   - Add analytics dashboards with charts (Recharts or Chart.js).  
   - Sales over time, average order value, repeat customer rate.  
   - Business Health KPIs with AI-powered explanations.  

3. **AI Recommendations**  
   - Recommend products for upsell/cross-sell based on order history.  
   - Suggest restocks for merchants using AI forecast.  
   - Predict customer churn risk (inactive customers).  

4. **Advanced Inventory**  
   - Track expiry dates, batch numbers, and FIFO logic.  
   - Show stock forecasting with days until product runs out.  
   - Restock reminders + low stock alerts.  
   - Multi-warehouse/outlet support.  

5. **Vendor Management**  
   - Manage vendors (CRUD: name, contact, payment terms).  
   - Create and track purchase orders linked to vendors.  
   - Track vendor performance (delivery times, order fulfillment).  
   - Alerts for overdue purchase orders.  

âœ… Requirements:  
- Use **React + TailwindCSS** for frontend.  
- Use **Express.js + MongoDB** for backend.  
- Integrate Shopify Admin API for pulling products, orders, customers.  
- Implement **role-based access** (Admin, Staff, Customer).  
- Add real-time notifications (low stock, new orders, expiring subs).  
- Code should be production-ready, bug-free, and modular.  

Now generate the **full working code (frontend + backend)** for these pages, including routes, services, and UI components, so that they are fully functional and seamlessly integrated into the existing ShopifyApp project.
