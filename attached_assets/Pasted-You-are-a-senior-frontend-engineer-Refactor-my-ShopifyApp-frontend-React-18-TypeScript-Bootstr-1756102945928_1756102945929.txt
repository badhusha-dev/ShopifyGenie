You are a senior frontend engineer. Refactor my ShopifyApp frontend (React 18 + TypeScript + Bootstrap 5 + JWT + RBAC + Shopify API integration) to use a **modern Bootstrap-based design** with animations and Shopify-inspired visuals.

Goal
Transform existing "dumb" Bootstrap pages into a **professional, animated, responsive web app** while keeping Bootstrap as the main framework.

Changes to Apply
1. Global Layout
   - Modern top navbar with brand logo, language switcher, notifications dropdown, and profile menu.
   - Collapsible sidebar with grouped items (Dashboard, Inventory, Customers, Loyalty, Subscriptions, Vendors, Intelligence, Settings).
   - Sidebar uses Bootstrap collapse/accordion with smooth animation.

2. Dashboard
   - KPI Cards: gradient backgrounds, Bootstrap cards with icons, hover scale effect.
   - Charts: integrate Chart.js with animated transitions.
   - Recent Orders Table: striped, hover, sticky header, fade-in animation.

3. Inventory
   - Filter bar styled with Bootstrap input groups + dropdowns.
   - Modern DataTable with hover effects, subtle row animations.
   - Add/Edit Modal: use Bootstrap Tabs (General | Pricing | Stock), animated slide-in.

4. Finance Dashboard
   - KPI Cards: Revenue, COGS, Margins, Refund % with animated counters.
   - Charts: Bootstrap grid + Chart.js line/pie/bar with fade-in animations.
   - Refunds/Wallets/Payouts tables with Bootstrap badges for status + animated modal actions.

5. System Settings
   - Bootstrap Nav Tabs with smooth fade transitions between General | Notifications | Security | Audit Logs.
   - Audit Logs Table with colored badges/icons for actions.

6. Integrations
   - Grid of Bootstrap cards for Stripe, SendGrid, Twilio, QuickBooks.
   - Each card: service logo, status badge, and “Connect/Test” button with hover animations.

7. UI Polish
   - Use Bootstrap utilities: rounded corners, shadows, spacing for modern look.
   - Animate.css or Bootstrap’s built-in transitions for fade, slide, bounce effects.
   - Toast notifications with fade-in/out animation.
   - Ensure all layouts are responsive (Bootstrap grid system).

Requirements
- Keep existing functionality, only enhance styles/animations.
- Use Bootstrap 5 components only (no Tailwind).
- Add smooth transitions for sidebar, modals, tabs, and cards.
- Maintain RBAC-based visibility rules for pages/actions.

Deliverables
- Updated global layout (Navbar + Sidebar).
- Restyled Dashboard, Inventory, Finance, Settings, Integrations pages using Bootstrap 5.
- Reusable Bootstrap components (AnimatedCard, KPI Card, AnimatedModal, DataTable).
